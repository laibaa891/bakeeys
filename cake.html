                To begin making the Eggless Whole Wheat Orange Cake recipe, preheat your oven to 180 degree C. <br>

                Sieve 1 cup whole wheat flour with corn flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and keep aside. <br>

                In a blender take, the granulated sugar, oil and blend well till the mixture get creamy.

                I made orange juice at home, you can take ready made juice too. <br>

                You can also blend the orange segments (seeds removed) and strain the  juice like I have done.
                 I used three medium oranges to get a bit more than 1 cup juice. <br>

               Now add 1 cup orange juice in the sugar oil mixture and stir well. <br>

              Now add the sieved flour mixture and 1 teaspoon orange zest to get a more dominant flavor of oranges, you can also add orange extract or essence. <br>

              To get the zest of orange, just grate the orange peel, before you peel the oranges. <br>

              Only grate the orange part, donâ€™t grate the white  part. <br>

              Mix everything very well with a spatula and check there should be no lumps in the cake batter. <br>

              Pour the batter in a lined or greased cake tin of about 6 inches. <br>

             Bake in a preheated oven for 180 degrees C for 30-35 minutes or till the tooth pick inserted in the centre comes out clean. <br>

             Transfer the cake on a wire rack and allow it to cool completely before cutting into slices.
