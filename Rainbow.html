                    Gather all ingredients. <br>

                    Overhead of rainbow cake ingredients in various bowls and containers. <br>
                   
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with baking spray and line with parchment paper; spray parchment with baking spray. <br>
            
                    
                    <h4> Prepare Cake: </h4> <h5> Beat butter in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until creamy, about 30 seconds. <br> Gradually add white sugar; beat until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.
                    
                    Overhead of standing mixer with cake batter being mixed in a bowl. <br>
                  
                    Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat just until incorporated after each addition, about 1 minute total. <br> Add vanilla and beat until combined, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl using a flexible spatula.

                    Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl until combined. <br>
                    
                    Overhead of a flour mixture in a glass bowl. <br>
                 
                    Add flour mixture to butter mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture, beating on low speed just until combined after each addition. <br>

                    Divide batter equally between 6 small bowls. Add one to two drops of food coloring to each bowl, tinting one bowl red or pink, <br> one orange, one yellow, one green, one blue and one purple.

                    Dollop the batter into the prepared pan, alternating colors, until the whole pan is filled. <br> [If you have leftover batter, top up existing dollops of the same color – don't make a second layer of different colors]. <br>Gently bang the pan on the counter to ensure that the batter is evenly distributed and that all gaps are filled.
                    
                    Overhead of different colored batters poured next to each other vertically in a baking dish. <br>
                    
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. <br> Cool in pan for 15 minutes. Remove cake from pan and cool on a wire rack until completely cool, at least 1 hour. <br></h5>
