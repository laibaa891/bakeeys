                1 teaspoon ground ginger <br>
                
                ½ teaspoon baking soda <br>
                 
                ½ teaspoon salt <br>
                
               
                 
                ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened <br>
                
                ¼ cup vegetable oil <br>
                 
                1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar <br>
                
                ¾ cup white sugar <br>
                 
                4 large eggs, at room temperature <br>
                
                2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
                
                1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature <br>
                
                1 ½ cups grated carrot <br>
                
                1 cup peeled and grated Granny Smith apple <br>
                
                ¾ cup raisins (Optional) <br>
                
                ¾ cup chopped pecans (Optional) <br>

                    Directions
                </h3>
               <h5>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch square pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. <br>

Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice together in a bowl; set aside. <br>

Beat butter, oil, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. <br> Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat batter for an additional 2 minutes after adding last egg. Beat in vanilla extract. Pour in half of the flour mixture; mix on low speed until just combined. Pour in buttermilk; mix until just combined. Pour in remaining flour mixture; mix until just combined. Fold in carrot, apple, raisins, and pecans.

Divide batter evenly between the two pans. Spread into an even layer in each pan. <br>

Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the cake springs back lightly when touched and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. <br>

Allow cakes to cool in pans for 20 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours more. <br>

Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until completely smooth; beat in cream cheese until smooth and thoroughly combined. <br> Beat in confectioners' sugar 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition; beat in vanilla and salt. Add in heavy cream; beat on medium-high until frosting is slightly fluffy, about 2 minutes.

Spread frosting onto one cooled cake layer. Stack layers; frost top and sides. <br>
