                All-Purpose Flour (divided, or more as needed) <br>
                2 (.25 ounces) packages
                Dry Yeast <br>
                1 cup

        <h5>
            Stir 2 cups flour and yeast together in a large bowl. Heat milk, water, oil, sugar, <br>
            and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until lukewarm; <br>
            add to flour mixture and beat until smooth, about 3 minutes. <br>

            Mix in 2 cups remaining flour, then add up to 1 cup more flour as necessary to make a soft dough. <br>
             Dust a flat surface with flour; turn dough out onto floured surface and let rest under a bowl for about 10 minutes. <br>
              Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking sheet. <br>

            Shape dough into 12 slightly flat balls and place on the prepared baking sheet to rise until doubled in size. <br>

            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). <br>

             Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes.
